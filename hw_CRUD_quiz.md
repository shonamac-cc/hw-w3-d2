# CRUD Quiz

Use the solution to this afternoon's Property Tracker lab to answer the following questions. Please write your answers under each question, push the file to GitHub, and submit in the usual way.

## MVP Questions

In our Property Tracker application:

Q1. Where are we instantiating instances of the `Property` class?
```In console.rb and we then call the save method which is defined in property.rb
```

Q2. Where are we defining the SQL that enables us to save the ruby `Property` object into the database?
```In the save method in property.rb in the sql variable
```

Q3. In `console.rb`, which lines modify the database?
```These modify the tables and data within the database
Property.delete_all
property1.delete
property1.save
property2.save
property3.save
```

Q4. Why do we not define the id of a `Property` object at the point we instantiate it (‘new it up’)?
```The DB handles assigning ID's as they can auto increment
```

Q5. Where and how do we assign the id (that is generated by the database) to the ruby `Property` object?
```In the save method
@id = db.exec_prepared("save", values)[0]["id"].to_i
```

Q6. Why do we put a guard (an `if` clause) on the `@id` attribute in the constructor?
```only assign the id when it exists in the DB, if not ignore it
```

Q7. Why are some of the CRUD actions represented by instance methods, and others by class methods?
```An instance should not necessarily know about data from any other instance whereas the Class should
e.g get all properties needs to be at the Class level as individual properties are not aware of other properties, and it's wrong for them to do so.
```

Q8. What type of data structure is returned by calls to `db.exec_prepared()`? In the `save` method, how do we access the id from the returned data structure?
```An array of hashes data structure
we look at the first item in the array and then specify the id key
```

Q9. Why do we use prepared statements when performing database operations?
```To avoid SQL Injection where an attacker tries to retrieve or delete data from databases.
```

## Extension Questions

Look at the `find_by_id` and `find_by_address` methods in the `Property` class.

Q10. What do they take in as their arguments?
```id number and address
```

Q11. What are their return values?
```hash of property or nil if none found that match the argument entered
```
